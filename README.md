Project Title: Real-time Traffic Monitoring and Prediction System

Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for real-time monitoring and prediction of traffic conditions. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes video feeds from traffic cameras to extract valuable insights, such as vehicle count, traffic density, and potential congestion points. This information is then utilized to generate accurate traffic predictions, enabling proactive traffic management and improved urban mobility.

Key Features and Functionalities:

Real-time Video Analysis:
The system processes live video streams from multiple traffic cameras to identify and track vehicles in real-time.
Vehicle Detection and Tracking: 
Employing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, the system accurately detects and tracks individual vehicles, even in challenging conditions like heavy traffic or poor lighting.
Traffic Density Estimation:
By analyzing the number and movement of vehicles, the system estimates traffic density at various locations, providing a quantitative measure of congestion levels.
Traffic Flow Prediction:
Leveraging historical traffic data and real-time observations, the system predicts future traffic conditions, helping to anticipate potential bottlenecks and congestion.
Visualization and Alerting:
The system provides a user-friendly interface to visualize traffic data, including heat maps, traffic flow charts, and real-time video feeds. It also generates alerts for critical traffic situations, such as accidents or severe congestion.

Technical Implementation:
Computer Vision:
OpenCV library is used for video processing, object detection, and tracking.
Machine Learning: 
Machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest, are employed for traffic prediction tasks.
Deep Learning: 
Deep learning models, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be explored for advanced video analysis and feature extraction.
